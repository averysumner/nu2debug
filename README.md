# nu2debug
A mod to enable debug menus in nu2 (TT's engine) games. Currently only works for LEGOÂ® Star Wars: The Complete Saga. This mod is meant to be used an example of how to make a mod for nu2 games using [mod_loader](https://github.com/lcdr/mod_loader).

# Features
Currently, nu2debug is able to toggle on an fps counter, a position display and a level loading display.

# Installation

# Usage
To keep this mod as simple and to the point as possible, the keys for the different debug options are hardcoded, feel free to fork this and make a version with a config. The keys are `F1` to toggle the FPS counter, `F2` to toggle the position display and `F3` to toggle the level loading display.
